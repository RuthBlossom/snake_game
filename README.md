# Snake Game

This Python script implements the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. Players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with itself and the edges of the screen.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Players can control the snake's movement using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Food Generation**: Food items appear randomly on the screen for the snake to consume, increasing its length.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the snake and the edges of the screen or itself, ending the game if a collision occurs.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each food item consumed.
- **Speed Control**: Players can adjust the speed of the snake by modifying the `time.sleep()` function call.

## How It Works

The script performs the following functions:

1. **Snake Initialization**: The game initializes a snake object with a default length and starting position on the screen.
2. **Control Binding**: Arrow key events are bound to corresponding methods in the snake object, allowing players to control its movement.
3. **Game Loop**: The game enters a loop where the screen is updated periodically, and the snake moves based on player input and game logic.
4. **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the snake and the edges of the screen or itself, ending the game if a collision occurs.
5. **Food Generation**: Food items appear randomly on the screen for the snake to consume, increasing its length.
6. **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each food item consumed.

## Usage

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
3. Consume food items to increase the snake's length and score.
4. Avoid collisions with the edges of the screen or the snake itself.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with the edges of the screen or itself.

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the game:

- **Snake Appearance**: Modify the appearance of the snake by adjusting parameters in the Snake class (e.g., color, size).
- **Game Speed**: Adjust the speed of the game by modifying the `time.sleep()` function call in the game loop.
- **Scoring Mechanism**: Implement custom scoring mechanisms or additional game features to enhance gameplay.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script utilizes the Turtle graphics library, which is included in the standard Python library.
